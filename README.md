# AbyssalCraft Heads
A small add-on for AbyssalCraft

### Main Information

AbyssalCraft heads is a small add-on to AbyssalCraft that adds heads for each entity in the mod (the "head" in question is a item textured with the entity's face).
The mod can be downloaded at http://minecraft.curseforge.com/mc-mods/229609-abyssalcraft-heads

### Licensing

This mod is licensed as "All Right Reserved", but the code can still be freely used in any way, as long as you rename everything and make it not look like I code in this repository (or something similar to those circumstances).

### Compiling and running

Eventhough this mod is entirely independant from AbyssalCraft, it still has it as a hard dependency, so if you want to run this mod inside a dev environment, you'd need to either remove AbyssalCraft from the dependency list in the @Mod annotation, or include a compiled version of AbyssalCraft from https://github.com/Shinoow/AbyssalCraft/tree/dev/jars/dev
In the future, there might be a maven repo for AbyssalCraft, so compiled jar files can easier be downloaded and imported.
